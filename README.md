# Gabmap

*Doing dialect analysis on the web*

The main website for Gabmap is [gabmap.nl](http://www.gabmap.nl/),
however, the web application running on that site is outdated, and no
longer supported by the author.

The current version of the web application is running on [the author's
site](http://www.let.rug.nl/~kleiweg/L04/webapp/).

To run Gabmap on your own web server, you can download it from Github,
but at the moment, there is no installation guide.

Or you can [run it in Docker](https://github.com/pebbe/Gabmap-docker).
