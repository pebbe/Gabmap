Step 4. Verwijs ook naar een uitleg over reguliere expressies!

Step 4, derde block: noem de [l] zonder tilde  'the dark (velar) l, which is
   standard in American speech' en  de [l] met tilde 'the light (palatal) [l],
   which is unusual.

uitleg 'representativeness':  Sounds are *representative* in a region to the
degree they appear in the various sites in the region.  A threshold may
be set to ensure that a sound must occur a minimal number of times.
Note that common sounds are typically quite representative (see below
in the explanation http://www.gabmap.nl/~app/doc/ClusterDeterminants/
for an example).

uitleg 'distinctivenss':  Distinctiveness is more complicated, but the
  the basic idea is that a sound (or a word pronunciation) is
*distinctive* in a
  dialect area with respect to a larger language area to the degree that
  it occurs exclusively in that (smaller) area.  The exact definitions are
  available in Wieling and Nerbonne (to appear).
