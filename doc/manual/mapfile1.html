<h2>Map file</h2>
<p>
You can create your map using  <a href="http://earth.google.com/" target="_top">Google Earth</a>. With Google Earth you can draw the borders of your area (add one ore more <b>polygons</b>) and add <b>placemarks</b> for the locations where the data was collected. Note that the place names have to be spelled exactly as in your data file. Optionally, you can add more details, like internal borders or rivers, to the map. When you have made the map in Google Earth, you save it as a .kml file or .kmz file, which can be uploaded directly in Gabmap.
</p>

<p>
A short manual for making a map with Google Earth is available <a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/~kleiweg/L04/kml/manual.html">here</a>. If you follow this manual you can skip the last step (Convert to RuG/L04), because the manual was made for the older Groningen software RuG/L04, but in Gabmap you can upload the .kml file directly.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a list of locations with coordinates, you can find a tool <a href="../../tools/ll2kml.html" target="_top">here</a> for converting it to .kml. Then you can open the converted file in Google Earth to add borders.
</p>

<p>
When a project has been created in Gabmap, an <a href="indexes-places.html">index map</a> is created, and the map can be inspected and downloaded as an image file. 
</p>

<p>
On several of the maps created in Gabmap each data point is represented by a colored polygon. The area of this polygon is computed automatically in Gabmap using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation" target="_top">Delaunay triangulation</a>.
