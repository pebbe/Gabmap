  <title>Cluster determinants: Raw data method</title>
</head>
<body>

Needs rewriting to make it understandable for the average user.
<p>
This methods works on the individual responses in the data. The result
      may be that we are comparing scores for items based on data that covers quite
      different areas, due to missing data. So, the scores may perhaps
      not be comparable. This may lead to a
      suboptimal ranking of the items. It doesn't effect the selection
      of patterns within an item.
<p>
Is this a problem? You don't need the values to be accurate. All you
      need is a sensible ranking. You may get some high-ranking items
      that don't lead you to a clear, determining feature. But this may
      happen even in the localised data method, perhaps not as often.  If it
      happens, just move on to the next item.
<p>
Different items can have different amounts of data, resulting in
      different error margins, so we correct for the median expected
      error, in order to
      get a more reliable comparison between items.  We do this by
      adding 1 to each count of <em>true positives</em>,  <em>false
      positives</em>,  <em>false negatives</em>, and <em>true
      negatives</em>. This
      method is based on the predictive values of small sample draws from large
      data sets.
