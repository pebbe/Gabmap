  <title>Cluster determinants: Adjusted F_1.5 score</title>
</head>
<body>

    Each pattern of each word is given a score for how well it fits with
    the desired cluster. The actual value is not that important. What is
    important is the relative order of the patterns based on the score.
    It should help to find the best fitting words with a combination of
    the best fitting patterns. Several methods of scoring have been
    tested, and usually, the one described below gives very useful results.
    <p>
      <hr>
<p>
      The <b>Adjusted F<sub>1.5</sub> score</b> is derived from the
      <b>F<sub>1</sub> score</b> (see: <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score">Wikipedia</a>).
      For this application, the F<sub>1</sub> score is modified in the
      following manners.
    <p>
      The F<sub>1</sub> score is based on <b>Precision</b> and
      <b>Recall</b>, which are based on counts of true and false
      positives and negatives. Here we add 1 to the count of each to
      prevent a possible division by zero in some corner cases:
      <p>
    <blockquote>
      TP = true positives + 1<br>
      FP = false positives + 1<br>
      FN = false negatives + 1<br>
      TN = true negatives + 1
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Then, Precision P and Recall R are calculated in the standard way:
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      P = TP / (TP + FP) <br>
      R = TP / (TP + FN)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The F<sub>1</sub> score functions well in very large datasets,
      where the target cluster a tiny fraction of the dataset.
      In this application, that is not the case. The target cluster can
      be one tenth of the dataset, or as big as more than half. That's
      why we use an <b>Adjusted Precision</b> AP and <b>Adjusted Recall</b> AR, by
      compensating for the <b>Baseline Precision</b> BP and <b>Baseline Recall</b> BR.
    <p>
      Baseline precision and recall are the values you get from a random
      sample of data:
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      BP = (TP + FN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN) <br>
      BR = (TP + FP) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The adjusted values for precision and recall are:
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      AP = (P &ndash; BP) / (1 &ndash; BP) <br>
      AR = (R &ndash; BR) / (1 &ndash; BR)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      P and R always have a value in the range from 0 to 1. This is not
      the case for AP and AR. The maximum value is still 1, but the
      values can now be negative as well.
    <p>
      When AP and AR are positive, we use the formula for the <b>F<sub>&beta;</sub> score</b>, setting
      &beta; to 1.5, to get the Adjusted F<sub>1.5</sub> score:
    <blockquote>
      &beta; = 1.5 <br>
      Adjusted F<sub>1.5</sub> score = (AP + &beta; &times; AR) / (1 + &beta;)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      (Tests showed that a value of 1.5 for &beta; works relatively well.) 
      <p>
      When AP or AR is zero or negative, the Adjusted F<sub>1.5</sub> score is zero.
    <p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      When all patterns for a single word have their Adjusted
      F<sub>1.5</sub> score, it's time to find the set of patterns that
      give the highest combined score.
    <p>
      First, the patterns are sorted by decreasing score. We create a
      new set, and put the first pattern in it, the pattern with the
      highest score. The score of the set is identical to the score of
      the first pattern.
    <p>
      Now, going down the list, for each pattern, we
      calculate the Adjusted F<sub>1.5</sub> score of the set when we
      have added the pattern to it. If it raises the score by a fraction of
      1.01 or more, the pattern is accepted, and stays in the set. If
      not, the pattern is rejected. Patterns down the line are always
      tested with the set of all already accepted patterns.
