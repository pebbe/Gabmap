<h4>File format</h4>

The data needs to be uploaded in a file with a single table. Each line
in the file is a row in the table. Table cells are separated by a
tab character. There are no quotes around the contents of a cell, and
the contents does not contain escape characters. I.e.: the content of
each cell is used at it is.
<p>
Lines starting with a hash (#) are considered comments, and ignored.
<p>
The first row in the table contains the labels for the items.
<p>
The first column in the table contains the names of the locations.
<p>
Each column (except column one) has all the variants of a single item
      for all locations.
<p>
Each row (except row one) has the variants of all items for a single
      locations.
<p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1">
<tr><td colspan="4"># this is a comment: ignored
<tr><th><th bgcolor="yellow">item 1<th bgcolor="yellow">item 2<th bgcolor="yellow">item 3
<tr><td bgcolor="yellow">place A<td>variant A1<td>variant A2<td>variant A3
<tr><td bgcolor="yellow">place B<td>variant B1<td>variant B2<td>variant B3
<tr><td bgcolor="yellow">place C<td>variant C1<td>variant C2<td>variant C3
<tr><td bgcolor="yellow">place D<td>variant D1<td>variant D2<td>variant D3
</table>
<p>
The first cell in the first row can be empty or missing. When missing,
      the first line has one cell less than all the other rows.
<p>
A cell may be empty for missing data.
<p>
When more than one variant exists for one item and one location, put
      both variants in a single cell, separated by these three
      characters: <u>space</u> <u>slash</u> <u>space</u>.
<p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1">
<tr><td>variant B2i / variant B2j
</table>
<p>
Note that all leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
