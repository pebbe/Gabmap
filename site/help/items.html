Some of the instances in your data may be omitted because they don't &quot;parse&quot;.<br>
This means usually that tokenisation fails, for example, an instance
    starts with an accent that should only appear after a vowel or
    consonant.
<p>
To see what instances were rejected, and why, go to your project page,
      and select <u>data overview</u> &rarr; <u>Errors</u>.
