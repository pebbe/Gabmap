  <title>Local incoherence</title>
</head>
<body>


<u>Local incoherence</u> is a numerical score of <em>local stress</em>, assigned to a set of differences
    between items, related to geographic distances between those items.
    The optimal score is 0 (zero). Non-optimal scores are positive
    values, with an undefined limit.
<p>
Comparing this score for different measurements on the same data gives you an idea what results are the
      more reliable. Lower values for Local incoherence means the
      results are better. You can also compare different measurements
      over different sets of data, as long as they are for the same set
      of locations.
<p>
Comparing the Local incoherence between data sets with different
      locations is meaningless, even if those locations are from the
      same geographic region.
<p>
The idea behind Local incoherence is that on average, locations that are
      close should be less different than locations farther apart
      (coherence), but any correlation between geographical distance and
      dissimilarity is lost over larger geographical distances (hence:
      local). 



<h4>Definition</h4>

<em>Local incoherence</em>, or <b>I<sub><i>L</i></sub></b> is defined as follows:
<p>
<img src="../img/linc-form.gif" width="236" height="240" alt="[formula]">
<p>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td><b><i>n</i></b>
    <td>Number of locations.
<tr valign="top"><td><b><i>d<sub>ij</sub></i></b>
    <td>The <em>geographical</em> distance between locations <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.
	These distances are ordered such that the corresponding <em>dialectological</em> difference
	between locations <i>i</i> and 1 is the smallest, between locations <i>i</i> and 2
	the second smallest, etc.

<tr valign="top"><td><b><i>d<big><sup>^</sup></big><sub>ij</sub></i></b>
    <td>Like <i>d<sub>ij</sub></i>, but distances are ordered according to
        <em>geographical</em> distance instead of according to
        dialectological difference.
        In other words:
        <i>A</i><big><sup>^</sup></big><sub><i>i</i></sub>
        is the optimal solution for <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>.

<tr valign="top"><td><b><i>k</i></b>
    <td>The upper limit for the number of dialectological neighbourhood
        locations used. We use <i>k</i>=8.
<tr valign="top"><td><b><i>p</i></b>
    <td>A parameter. We use 0.5.
</table>
<p>
Whenever there is a series of identical dialectological differences, the
geographic distances are averaged for those pairs of locations.
