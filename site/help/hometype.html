How do you want the differences between two strings to be calculated? You
    can select one of several methods.

<h4>default</h4>

<dl>
<dt>automatic
<dd>If your data looks more or less like IPA, this will select
	<u>vowel/consonant alignments</u> (see below). If it doesn't
	look like IPA, this will select <u>plain</u> (see below).
</dl>

<h4>string edit distance</h4>

<dl>
<dt>plain
<dd>This is the simplest form of edit distance. An instance is considered to
be just a string of characters, and the edit distance is just a
sum of cost of substitutions, insertions and deletions to
convert one string in another (normalised for string lengths).<br>
<span class="todo">To do: details like normalisation function,
	  substitutions versus indels.</span>

<dt>tokenized
<dd>Like vowel/consonant alignments below, but without forced alignments.

<dt>vowel/consonant alignments
<dd>In this case, the edit distance algorithm disallows substitution of
	a vowel by a consonant <span class="todo">(more details: semi-vowels, other
	characters)</span>. So vowels can only align with vowels (or semi-vowels)
	and consonants can only align with consonants (or
	semi-vowels).<br>
To achieve this, diacritics are considered to be modifiers of the vowel
	or consonant they follow. So there is a preprocessing step taking
	place, where each unique combination of vowel or consonant (or
	semi-vowel) and the following diacritics are combined into a
	single unique token. String edit distance is then applied to
	strings of these new tokens.<br>
Combining groups of characters into a single token reduces information,
	so this would lead to less accurate results. To prevent this,
	the string edit substitution operation is weighted in such a
	manner that two different vowels are more distinct than two
	identical vowels, differing only in diacritics.<br>
To decide what tokens are vowels, consonants, diacritics, etc, the data
	must be in IPA or IPA-like encoding (APA, UPA...)
<dt>vowel/consonant alignments — strict IPA
<dd>This is like the previous method, but when an instance contains one
	or more characters that are not valid IPA characters, an error
	is raised, and the instance is not used.

</dl>

<h4>other distances</h4>

<dl>
<dt>binary comparison
<dd>Two strings are either the same (distance zero) or different
	(distance one).<br>
   You can use this only for categorical data, like linguistic
	variants. You can't use it to compare detailed data like
	phonetic transcriptions, because there may not be many identical
	variants in the data.

<dt>Gewichteter Identitätswert
<dd>See Goedl... Not for phonetic transcriptions. <span class="todo">To
	  do: more</span>

<dt>Hamming distance
<dd>Strings in one column must all be of the same length. <span class="todo">To
	  do: more</span>

<dt>numeric distance
<dd>A tabel consists of numeric values, one value in each cell, or
	<em>NA</em> if the value is unavailable. Empty cells are not
	allowed. Alternatives are not allowed.
<span class="todo">To
	  do: more</span>

</dl>
