<h1>Overviews of the data</h1>

<p>
When a project has been created, the menus in the <i>project view</i> show all the different types of results that have been created of the data. You can click on the topics to see the results. To return to the project view, you can click on the project in the upper left corner of the screen at any time.
</p>

<h2>Indexes</h2>

<p>
Indexes are created of the data sites and of the items in the data set. By clicking on <i>places</i> in the project view, you will see index maps of all the sites.
</p>

<p>
When you click on <i>items</i> in the project view, you get a list of the linguistic variables and the number of occurrences of each variable. Note that since there might be multiple transcriptions of one item from a single site and/or missing data, the number of instances of a variable might be smaller or greater than the number of places in the data set
</p>


<h2>Data overview</h2>

<p>
By clicking on <i>data overview</i> in the project view you get all kinds of summaries of the data. For example, you get a list with the total number of places in the data, the number of linguistic variables (items), the number of different characters used in the transcriptions etc. There is also a list of all the characters and a list of tokens. A token is a combination of a phonetic symbol and diacritical marks. You can try clicking on one of the blue numbers (which indicate number of occurrences) in the character or token list to see a map of the geographic distribution of the character/token. The darker the color on the map, the more frequent the character/token. Examples of the character/token are shown below the map.
</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
   <td><img src="images/ink.jpg" alt="Exercise"/></td>
   <td>Click on the blue number next to ‘t’ in the character list. What does the map show? Can you think of a linguistic explanation for the map?</td>
</tr>
</table> 

<p>
Any of the maps in Gabmap can be downloaded by right-clicking on one of the file formats to the right of the map and choosing <i>Save Target As...</i>.
</p>

<p>
The character list with the number of occurrences of each symbol can be a very useful way of detecting errors in your own data sets, since very infrequent symbols might be typos.
