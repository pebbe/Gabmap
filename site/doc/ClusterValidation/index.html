<h1>Gabmap: cluster validation - demonstration</h1>
This demonstration uses data from Germany
</div>

<div>
<h3>The problem</h3>
The result of clustering can be deceptive. 
<p>
You ask for six clusters, and
you get six clusters, no matter if there are actually more
clusters in the data, or even less.
<p>
Sometimes it is clear that the clusters you get are useless, that you
are only clustering noise. You can see this in the map below:

<p>
<img src="img00.png">
<p>
But usually, the result looks quite acceptable, like in the following
	map:
<p>
<img src="img01.png">
<p>
What you get not only depends on how many clusters you ask for.
Different clustering methods give different results. And 
clustering is highly sensitive to small amounts of noise.	
Furthermore, you can't see the difference between major and minor
cluster devisions. (Even dendrograms, that suggest a hierarchy, are not
	realiable in this respect.)

</div>

<div>
<h3>Validation with the help of multi-dimensional scaling</h3>

An MDS plot in two dimension, using the same colours as those used in
      the clustering, shows you how the major devisions of the data
      are.<br>
(Numbers indicate the most exceptional points in each cluster.)
<p>
<img src="img02.png">
<p>
You can see a clear devision between north and south. This plot also
	shows that the dark blue cluster seems to belong partly to the
	north group and partly to the south group. So this colour
	actually is not a single cluster.

</div>

<div>
Let's increase the number of clusters from seven to eleven:
<p>
<img src="img03.png">
<p>
</div>

<div>
Here are the map and the MDS plot of the devision in eleven clusters:
<p>
<img src="img04.png">
<p>
<img src="img05.png">
<p>
The previous dark blue cluster is now split in two, a yellow cluster that
	belongs to the north, and a dark blue cluster that belongs to
	the south.
</div>

<div>
We have identified a north group and a south group. What about
	the clusters within these groups? Are they valid?
<p>
First, let's have a closer look at the north. We remove all clusters
from the south from the plot:
<p>
<img src="img04n.png">
<p>
<img src="img06.png">
This gives MDS the chance to redistribute a smaller part of the data,
	giving more room to clusters in the data to separate
	themselves. Indeed, colours that in the previous plot
	looked jumbled now appear spatially ordered:
<p>
<img src="img07.png">
<p>
However, are these really four distinct clusters?
</div>

<div>
Here's is what the above plot looks like if you don't have colours:
<p>
<img src="img07a.png">
<p>
The cluster that was yellow seems alright as a real cluster, but it is
	not possible to point to a distinct cluster in the other parts
	of the plot.
<p>
So, what is happening here?
<p>
It seems (based on the data) that the north is not a region of separate dialects, but a
	continuum, with language changing gradually over distance. Pink
	is clearly at the west as one end of the continuum, and yellow
	is the other end in the east. But borders within this continuum
	are arbitrary, especially between pink and light blue, and
	between light
	blue and light purple.
<p>
</div>

<div>
Now, let's have a closer look at the south. There we have seven clusters
      at the moment, but in the complete MDS plot, it all looks jumbled.
<p>
So we make an MDS plot with data from the north omitted:
<p>
<img src="img04s.png">
<p>
<img src="img09.png">
<p>
This shows another two major groups. One in the middle of Germany with
	dark and light orange, dark purple and dark blue. And the other
	group in southern Germany with red and dark and light green.
<p>
The location marked "28" is one of the exceptional locations in the dark
	green
	cluster, as you can see in both map and MDS plot.  It
	doesn't belong to the south. The clustering algorithm got it wrong.
</div>

<div>
Zooming in even more. In the previous MDS plot, red and green looked
      like a single cluster mixed together. This is what it looks like
      if we make an MDS plot of only these two clusters:
<p>
<img src="img10.png">
<p>
Red and green are no longer mixed, but the spatial distribution suggests
	there is no real cluster border. (Imagine this plot without
	colours.) So this is probably an area
	with a gradual dialect transition from north to south.
</div>

<div>
You can continue this process of zooming in on smaller parts of the map,
      looking for, and checking sub-clusters.
<p>
A few words of caution.
<p>
MDS is much more stable than clustering, but it isn't perfect either.
<p>
The results you get are only as good as your data. You may miss dialects
	because the data isn't detailed enough. You may also see
	clusters that don't correspond to dialects, but to some artifact
	in the data, for instance, multiple fieldworkers, or tiny
	variations in the manner of data gathering, that show only in the final analysis.
