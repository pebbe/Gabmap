<h1>Gabmap: cluster determinants - demonstration</h1>
This demonstration uses data from LAMSAS for Pennsylvania, USA
<ul>
<li>map: <a href="../../examples/Demo-Pennsylvania.kml">Demo-Pennsylvania.kml</a>
<li>data: <a href="../../examples/Demo-Pennsylvania.txt">Demo-Pennsylvania.txt</a>
</ul>

<h3>Step 1: select number of clusters</h3>
At the start, there is a map with six areas for you to
      choose from. You can increase the number of clusters to get
      smaller areas, or decrease the number of clusters to get larger
      areas.
<p>
Let's reduce the number of clusters to four:
<p>

</div>

<div>
There are now four areas:
<p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Step 2: select cluster</h3>
Now you select the area you are interested in.
<p>
At this stage, you also
choose what special characters should be included in the search for
relevant patterns. Usually, diacritics are ignored because they
introduce too much detail, hiding the more global features. 
(Characters known to be vowels, semi-vowels or consonants are used always.)
However, some diacritics may be needed to be able to find important
distinctions. For instance, if you expect there may be a contrast
of
<span class="ipa2">t</span> (non-aspirated t) versus <span
	  class="ipa2">t&#688;</span> (aspirated t),
      you should check the box for <span class="ipa2">&#688;</span>.
<p>
Some diacritics can be hard to recognise. To help you, if you move your mouse over
	it, you get to see the official Unicode name of the character,
	for instance <tt><small><u>MODIFIER LETTER SMALL H</u></small></tt> for <span class="ipa2">&#688;</span>.
<p>

<p>
Our data for Pennsylvania doesn't have special characters for
	aspiration. The special characters it does have are shown below.


<p>
Don't select any special characters. Just pick the light
      blue area:
<p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>step 3: select item</h3>
The server needs some time to score all words and their variants for the
      area you have chosen. When it is finished, you get a list of words to
      choose from. These words are ordered by score for the
      selected area, starting with
      the highest scoring word at the top. 
<p>
After each word there are two numbers. The second number is how many instances of
the word were found to be relevant. The first number is how many of
these were actually in the selected area.

<p>
Let's pick the first word, <em>Philadelphia</em>.
<p>
<img src="screen04.png">
</div>

<div>
After you selected a word, you get a list of all variants of that word
      that contributed to the score for the area you selected (the
      light blue area), as well as a list with rejected patterns:
<p>
<img src="screen05.png">
<p>
You also get a distribution map for the relevant variants. De locations
belonging to the selected area are marked with a dot:
<p>
<img src="screen06.png">
<p>
This distribution map matches quite well with the light blue area:
<p>
<img src="screen01.png">
</div>

<div>
<h3>Step 4: try for determinant feature</h3>
Now, what is it about these patterns of the word <em>Philadelphia</em>
      that are so characteristic of the light blue area?
<p>
Compare the matching patterns with the rejected patterns.
How are they different? The relevant
patterns have <span class="ipa2">l</span> where other patterns
have <span class="ipa2">&#619;</span>. So lets see what that gives
us:
<p>
<img src="screen07.png">
<p>
<a href="../../bin/help?s=regex" class="more">Read more about regular expressions&rarr;</a>
</div>

<div>
Here is what you get with the selection of variants with <span class="ipa2">l</span>:
<p>
<img src="screen10.png">
<p>
It's not quite OK. There are too many variants, in a larger area than the initial
match:
<p>
<img src="screen11.png">
</div>

<div>
We have found matches with one <span class="ipa2">l</span> and one <span
	class="ipa2">&#619;</span>, but <span class="ipa2">&#619;</span> doesn't
	occur at all in the relevant matches. So, try a pattern with two
	occurrences of <span class="ipa2">l</span>:
<p>
<img src="screen12.png">
<p>
This is identical to the list of variants we started with, and the
	distribution map is identical too:
<p>
<img src="screen13.png">
</div>

<div>
We have found our determining feature for the light blue area (in the
      word <em>Philadelphia</em>): only <span class="ipa2">l</span> (or <span
      class="ipa2">l&#791;</span>) where other areas have <span class="ipa2">&#619;</span>.
</div>

<div>
<h3>The next steps</h3>
The next question is, is this <span class="ipa2">l</span> the
      determining feature in the word <em>Philadelphia</em> only, or in
      other words as well?
<p>
Try the next word on the list with an 'l', <em>quilt</em>:
<p>
<img src="screen15.png">
</div>

<div>
The results for <em>quilt</em> (not shown) are similar to those for
      <em>Philadelphia</em>. Before going on to the next word, you may
      ask whether <span class="ipa2">l</span> is the determining feature
      in all words.
</div>

<div>
Go to the main page for your project, and then to <u>data overview</u>.
<p>
In data overview, go to <u>Sample search</u>:
<p>
<img src="screen16.png">
<p>
Enter a search pattern that has at least one <span class="ipa2">l</span>,
	and no <span class="ipa2">&#619;</span> at all:
<p>
<img src="screen17.png">
</div>

<div>
You get a distribution map of matching words:
<p>
<img src="screen18.png">
<p>
You can see that <span class="ipa2">l</span> is quite dominant in the
	target area, but occurs quite often in all other areas as well.
<p>
You also get a random list of matching words:
<p>
<img src="screen19.png">
</div>

<div>
So, back to <u>cluster determinants</u>
<p>
Keep trying, and you come to <em>St. Louis</em>, the first word that
	shows different results.
<p>
All matching words have <span class="ipa2">l</span>, not <span
	  class="ipa2">&#619;</span>, but many rejected patterns have
	  <span class="ipa2">l</span> as well:
<p>
<img src="screen20.png">
</div>

<div>
When you try for words with <span class="ipa2">l</span> in Step 4, you
      see this is not a determining feature for the target area.
<p>
<img src="screen21.png">
<p>
<img src="screen22.png">
</div>

<div>
<h3>That's it</h3>
You found that <span class="ipa2">l</span> is a determining feature for
the light blue area, but not in all words. It looks like the
position in the word matters. Like, not at the beginning
of a word, or at the beginning of some syllables.
<p>
<img src="screen01.png">
</div>

<div>
Of course, this doesn't have to be the only determining feature for this
	area. Other words may help you find other determining features.
	What about <em>nice day</em>? It is near the top of the list, but
	has no 'l' in it.
